# CSFlashPlayer
Adding support for modern browsers to open SWF in Adobe with CSFP.

## How to use:

1. Download this tool from release.
2. Extract it to any location you want.
3. Run CSFP.exe one time, accept user admin control pop out to update registry.
4. Open a flash page that supports CSFlashPlayer, click the "PLAY with CSFlashPlayer" link.

## How to use on all sites:

* We need a user script to add buttons on flash plugin objects (NOT READY!).

1. Install user script browser extension Tampermonkey.  
   Chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo  
   Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/   
2. Click Tampermonkey icon -> Dashboard -> Utilities -> Install from URL, copy and paste this url to install: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/6306/CSFlashPlayer/main/ScriptInjector.user.js

## How to use for Webmaster:

You will need to combine the scheme header with base64 encoded SWF full pathÂ as a launch url using the example below.
Example: var url = "csflash://" + base64encode("http://yoursite.com/"+swfpath);

Hints for Webmaster:
* SWFpath does not need a urlencode.
* Modern browsers has built in base64encode function, just: btoa(swfpath) .
* If you open the launch url in a new window, it will leave a blank window, if not, the web page will stop functioning after launch. Solution: Open in a hidden iframe.
